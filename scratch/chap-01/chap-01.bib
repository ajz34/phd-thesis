  abstract = {For dealing with atoms involving many electrons the accurate quantum theory, involving a solution of the wave equation in many-dimensional space, is far too complicated to be practicable. One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2π
              h
              )
              3
              , and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

Lett. 91, 146401 (2003)] for the exchange-correlation energy, imposing exact constraints relevant to the paradigm densities of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. Results of their extensive tests on molecules, solids, and solid surfaces are encouraging, suggesting that this density functional achieves uniform accuracy for diverse properties and systems. In the present work, this functional is explained and details of its construction are presented. In particular, the functional is constructed to yield accurate energies under uniform coordinate scaling to the low-density or strong-interaction limit. Its nonlocality is displayed by plotting the factor Fxc that gives the enhancement relative to the local density approximation for exchange. We also discuss an apparently harmless order-of-limits problem in the meta-GGA. The performance of this functional is investigated for exchange and correlation energies and shell-removal energies of atoms and ions. Non-self-consistent molecular atomization energies and bond lengths of the TPSS meta-GGA, calculated with GGA orbitals and densities, agree well with those calculated self-consistently. We suggest that satisfaction of additional exact constraints on higher rungs of a ladder of density functional approximations can lead to further progress.},

  abstract = {In order to discriminate between approximations to the exchange-correlation energy EXC[ρ↑,ρ↓], we employ the criterion of whether the functional is fitted to a certain experimental data set or if it is constructed to satisfy physical constraints. We present extensive test calculations for atoms and molecules, with the nonempirical local spin-density (LSD) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and compare our results with results obtained with more empirical functionals. For the atomization energies of the G2 set, we find that the PBE functional shows systematic errors larger than those of commonly used empirical functionals. The PBE ionization potentials, electron affinities, and bond lengths are of accuracy similar to those obtained from empirical functionals. Furthermore, a recently proposed hybrid scheme using exact exchange together with PBE exchange and correlation is investigated. For all properties studied here, the PBE hybrid gives an accuracy comparable to the frequently used empirical B3LYP hybrid scheme. Physical principles underlying the PBE and PBE hybrid scheme are examined and the range of their validity is discussed.},

The calculated results of the long-range correction scheme are found to support a previous argument that the lack of the long-range interactions in conventional exchange functionals may be responsible for the underestimation of 4s−3d interconfigurational energies of the first-row transition metals and for the overestimation of the longitudinal polarizabilities of π-conjugated polyenes in DFT calculations.},

  abstract   = {We report a global-hybrid approximation, MN15, to the exchange–correlation functional of Kohn–Sham theory with broadly accurate performance for both multi-reference and single-reference systems.
          , 
            
              Kohn–Sham density functionals are widely used; however, no currently available exchange–correlation functional can predict all chemical properties with chemical accuracy. Here we report a new functional, called MN15, that has broader accuracy than any previously available one. The properties considered in the parameterization include bond energies, atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, isomerization energies, electronic excitation energies, absolute atomic energies, and molecular structures. When compared with 82 other density functionals that have been defined in the literature, MN15 gives the second smallest mean unsigned error (MUE) for 54 data on inherently multiconfigurational systems, the smallest MUE for 313 single-reference chemical data, and the smallest MUE on 87 noncovalent data, with MUEs for these three categories of 4.75, 1.85, and 0.25 kcal mol
              −1
              , respectively, as compared to the average MUEs of the other 82 functionals of 14.0, 4.63, and 1.98 kcal mol
              −1
              . The MUE for 17 absolute atomic energies is 7.4 kcal mol
              −1
              as compared to an average MUE of the other 82 functionals of 34.6 kcal mol
              −1
              . We further tested MN15 for 10 transition-metal coordination energies, the entire S66x8 database of noncovalent interactions, 21 transition-metal reaction barrier heights, 69 electronic excitation energies of organic molecules, 31 semiconductor band gaps, seven transition-metal dimer bond lengths, and 193 bond lengths of 47 organic molecules. The MN15 functional not only performs very well for our training set, which has 481 pieces of data, but also performs very well for our test set, which has 823 data that are not in our training set. The test set includes both ground-state properties and molecular excitation energies. For the latter MN15 achieves simultaneous accuracy for both valence and Rydberg electronic excitations when used with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory, with an MUE of less than 0.3 eV for both types of excitations.},

This local hybrid approach is computationally feasible for a wide range of molecules. In this work, the local mix of HF and DFT exchange is driven by the ratio of τW={\textbar}∇ρ{\textbar}2/8ρ, the Weizsäcker kinetic energy density, with τ, the exact kinetic energy density. This particular choice of local mix yields 100\% of exact exchange in one-electron regions. Dissociation energy curves, binding energies, and equilibrium geometries for two-center, three-electron symmetric radical cations can be modeled accurately using this scheme. We also report encouraging results for reaction energy barriers, and somewhat disappointing atomization energies for the small G2 set.},

  abstract = {The direct random phase approximation (dRPA) combined with Kohn–Sham reference orbitals is among the most promising tools in computational chemistry and applicable in many areas of chemistry and physics. The reason for this is that it scales as N4 with the system size, which is a considerable advantage over the accurate ab initio wave function methods like standard coupled-cluster. dRPA also yields a considerably more accurate description of thermodynamic and electronic properties than standard density-functional theory methods. It is also able to describe strong static electron correlation effects even in large systems with a small or vanishing band gap missed by common single-reference methods. However, dRPA has several flaws due to its self-correlation error. In order to obtain accurate and precise reaction energies, barriers and noncovalent intra- and intermolecular interactions, we construct a new dual-hybrid dRPA (hybridization of exact and semilocal exchange in both the energy and the orbitals) and test the performance of this new functional on isogyric, isodesmic, hypohomodesmotic, homodesmotic, and hyperhomodesmotic reaction classes. We also use a test set of 14 Diels–Alder reactions, six atomization energies (AE6), 38 hydrocarbon atomization energies, and 100 reaction barrier heights (DBH24, HT-BH38, and NHT-BH38). For noncovalent complexes, we use the NCCE31 and S22 test sets. To test the intramolecular interactions, we use a set of alkane, cysteine, phenylalanine-glycine-glycine tripeptide, and monosaccharide conformers. We also discuss the delocalization and static correlation errors. We show that a universally accurate description of chemical properties can be provided by a large, 75\% exact exchange mixing both in the calculation of the reference orbitals and the final energy.},

  abstract   = {Double hybrid (DH) density functionals are amongst the most accurate density functional approximations developed so far, largely due to the incorporation of correlation effects from unoccupied orbitals via second order perturbation theory (PT2). The xDH family of DH functionals calculate energy directly from orbitals optimized by a lower level approach like B3LYP, without self-consistent optimization. XYG3 and XYGJ-OS are two widely used xDH functionals that are known to be quite accurate at equilibrium geometries. Here, we show that the XYG3 and XYGJ-OS functionals can be ill behaved for stretched bonds well beyond the Coulson-Fischer point, predicting unphysical dipole moments and humps in potential energy curves for some simple systems like the hydrogen fluoride molecule. Numerical experiments and analysis show that these failures are not due to PT2. Instead, a large mismatch at stretched bond-lengths between the reference B3LYP orbitals and the optimized orbitals associated with the non-PT2 part of XYG3 leads to an unphysically large non-Hellman-Feynman contribution to first order properties like forces and electron densities.},

              We present the GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions. Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme
              J. Chem. Theory Comput.
              , 2011,
              7
              , 291], it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems—with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time—and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community
              via
              a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.},

  abstract = {A simple modification of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.},

  abstract = {Whither the density in DFT calculations?
            
              The continuing development of density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded the size and complexity of molecules amenable to computationally tractable simulation. The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev
              et al.
              examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density.

            Certain recent approaches to density functional theory have sacrificed fidelity to the true electron density.
          , 
            The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.},

  abstract  = {Non-covalent interactions (NCIs) play a crucial role in biology, chemistry, material science, and everything in between. To improve pure quantum-chemical simulations of NCIs, we propose a methodology for constructing approximate correlation energies by combining an interpolation along the M\{{\textbackslash}o\}ller adiabatic connection (MP AC) with a regularization and spin-scaling strategy applied to MP2 correlation energies. This combination yields \$c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}\$-SPL2, which exhibits superior accuracy for NCIs compared to any of the individual strategies. With the \$N{\textasciicircum}4\$ formal scaling, \$c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}\$-SPL2, is competitive or often outperforms more expensive dispersion-corrected double hybrids for NCIs.The accuracy of \$c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}\$-SPL2 particularly shines for anionic halogen bonded complexes, where it surpasses standard dispersion-corrected DFT by a factor of 3 to 5.},

  abstract = {In this Communication, we assess a panel of 18 double-hybrid density functionals for the modeling of the thermochemical and kinetic properties of an extended dataset of 449 organic chemistry reactions belonging to the BH9 database. We show that most of DHs provide a statistically robust performance to model barrier height and reaction energies in reaching the “chemical accuracy.” In particular, we show that nonempirical DHs, such as PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH, or minimally parameterized alternatives, such as ωB2PLYP and B2K-PLYP, succeed to accurately model both properties in a balanced fashion. We demonstrate, however, that parameterized approaches, such as ωB97X-2 or DSD-like DHs, are more biased to only one of both properties.},

Towards the rational design of catalysts, the growing demand on theoretical study is seriously at odds with the low accuracy of the most widely used functionals of generalized gradient approximation. Here, we present results using a hybrid scheme that combines the doubly hybrid XYG3 functional and the periodic generalized gradient approximation, whose accuracy is validated against an experimental set on copper surfaces. A near chemical accuracy is established for this set, which, in turn, leads to a substantial improvement for the calculated equilibrium and onset potentials as against the experimental values for CO

              Static polarizabilities are the first response of the electron density to electric fields, and are therefore important for predicting intermolecular and molecule-field interactions. They also offer a global measure of the accuracy of the treatment of excited states by density functionals in a formally exact manner. We have developed a database of benchmark static polarizabilities for 132 small species at equilibrium geometry, using coupled cluster theory through triple excitations (extrapolated to the complete basis set limit), for the purpose of developing and assessing density functionals. The performance of 60 popular and recent functionals are also assessed, which indicates that double hybrid functionals perform the best, having RMS relative errors in the range of 2.5–3.8\%. Many hybrid functionals also give quite reasonable estimates with 4–5\% RMS relative error. A few

              -GGAs like mBEEF and MVS yield performance comparable to hybrids, indicating potential for improved excited state predictions relative to typical local functionals. Some recent functionals however are found to be prone to catastrophic failure (possibly as a consequence of overparameterization), indicating a need for caution in applying these.},
