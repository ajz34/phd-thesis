  abstract = {For dealing with atoms involving many electrons the accurate quantum theory, involving a solution of the wave equation in many-dimensional space, is far too complicated to be practicable. One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2π
              h
              )
              3
              , and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

Lett. 91, 146401 (2003)] for the exchange-correlation energy, imposing exact constraints relevant to the paradigm densities of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. Results of their extensive tests on molecules, solids, and solid surfaces are encouraging, suggesting that this density functional achieves uniform accuracy for diverse properties and systems. In the present work, this functional is explained and details of its construction are presented. In particular, the functional is constructed to yield accurate energies under uniform coordinate scaling to the low-density or strong-interaction limit. Its nonlocality is displayed by plotting the factor Fxc that gives the enhancement relative to the local density approximation for exchange. We also discuss an apparently harmless order-of-limits problem in the meta-GGA. The performance of this functional is investigated for exchange and correlation energies and shell-removal energies of atoms and ions. Non-self-consistent molecular atomization energies and bond lengths of the TPSS meta-GGA, calculated with GGA orbitals and densities, agree well with those calculated self-consistently. We suggest that satisfaction of additional exact constraints on higher rungs of a ladder of density functional approximations can lead to further progress.},

  abstract = {In order to discriminate between approximations to the exchange-correlation energy EXC[ρ↑,ρ↓], we employ the criterion of whether the functional is fitted to a certain experimental data set or if it is constructed to satisfy physical constraints. We present extensive test calculations for atoms and molecules, with the nonempirical local spin-density (LSD) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and compare our results with results obtained with more empirical functionals. For the atomization energies of the G2 set, we find that the PBE functional shows systematic errors larger than those of commonly used empirical functionals. The PBE ionization potentials, electron affinities, and bond lengths are of accuracy similar to those obtained from empirical functionals. Furthermore, a recently proposed hybrid scheme using exact exchange together with PBE exchange and correlation is investigated. For all properties studied here, the PBE hybrid gives an accuracy comparable to the frequently used empirical B3LYP hybrid scheme. Physical principles underlying the PBE and PBE hybrid scheme are examined and the range of their validity is discussed.},

  abstract   = {We report a global-hybrid approximation, MN15, to the exchange–correlation functional of Kohn–Sham theory with broadly accurate performance for both multi-reference and single-reference systems.
          , 
            
              Kohn–Sham density functionals are widely used; however, no currently available exchange–correlation functional can predict all chemical properties with chemical accuracy. Here we report a new functional, called MN15, that has broader accuracy than any previously available one. The properties considered in the parameterization include bond energies, atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, isomerization energies, electronic excitation energies, absolute atomic energies, and molecular structures. When compared with 82 other density functionals that have been defined in the literature, MN15 gives the second smallest mean unsigned error (MUE) for 54 data on inherently multiconfigurational systems, the smallest MUE for 313 single-reference chemical data, and the smallest MUE on 87 noncovalent data, with MUEs for these three categories of 4.75, 1.85, and 0.25 kcal mol
              −1
              , respectively, as compared to the average MUEs of the other 82 functionals of 14.0, 4.63, and 1.98 kcal mol
              −1
              . The MUE for 17 absolute atomic energies is 7.4 kcal mol
              −1
              as compared to an average MUE of the other 82 functionals of 34.6 kcal mol
              −1
              . We further tested MN15 for 10 transition-metal coordination energies, the entire S66x8 database of noncovalent interactions, 21 transition-metal reaction barrier heights, 69 electronic excitation energies of organic molecules, 31 semiconductor band gaps, seven transition-metal dimer bond lengths, and 193 bond lengths of 47 organic molecules. The MN15 functional not only performs very well for our training set, which has 481 pieces of data, but also performs very well for our test set, which has 823 data that are not in our training set. The test set includes both ground-state properties and molecular excitation energies. For the latter MN15 achieves simultaneous accuracy for both valence and Rydberg electronic excitations when used with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory, with an MUE of less than 0.3 eV for both types of excitations.},

This local hybrid approach is computationally feasible for a wide range of molecules. In this work, the local mix of HF and DFT exchange is driven by the ratio of τW={\textbar}∇ρ{\textbar}2/8ρ, the Weizsäcker kinetic energy density, with τ, the exact kinetic energy density. This particular choice of local mix yields 100\% of exact exchange in one-electron regions. Dissociation energy curves, binding energies, and equilibrium geometries for two-center, three-electron symmetric radical cations can be modeled accurately using this scheme. We also report encouraging results for reaction energy barriers, and somewhat disappointing atomization energies for the small G2 set.},

  abstract = {The direct random phase approximation (dRPA) combined with Kohn–Sham reference orbitals is among the most promising tools in computational chemistry and applicable in many areas of chemistry and physics. The reason for this is that it scales as N4 with the system size, which is a considerable advantage over the accurate ab initio wave function methods like standard coupled-cluster. dRPA also yields a considerably more accurate description of thermodynamic and electronic properties than standard density-functional theory methods. It is also able to describe strong static electron correlation effects even in large systems with a small or vanishing band gap missed by common single-reference methods. However, dRPA has several flaws due to its self-correlation error. In order to obtain accurate and precise reaction energies, barriers and noncovalent intra- and intermolecular interactions, we construct a new dual-hybrid dRPA (hybridization of exact and semilocal exchange in both the energy and the orbitals) and test the performance of this new functional on isogyric, isodesmic, hypohomodesmotic, homodesmotic, and hyperhomodesmotic reaction classes. We also use a test set of 14 Diels–Alder reactions, six atomization energies (AE6), 38 hydrocarbon atomization energies, and 100 reaction barrier heights (DBH24, HT-BH38, and NHT-BH38). For noncovalent complexes, we use the NCCE31 and S22 test sets. To test the intramolecular interactions, we use a set of alkane, cysteine, phenylalanine-glycine-glycine tripeptide, and monosaccharide conformers. We also discuss the delocalization and static correlation errors. We show that a universally accurate description of chemical properties can be provided by a large, 75\% exact exchange mixing both in the calculation of the reference orbitals and the final energy.},

  abstract   = {Double hybrid (DH) density functionals are amongst the most accurate density functional approximations developed so far, largely due to the incorporation of correlation effects from unoccupied orbitals via second order perturbation theory (PT2). The xDH family of DH functionals calculate energy directly from orbitals optimized by a lower level approach like B3LYP, without self-consistent optimization. XYG3 and XYGJ-OS are two widely used xDH functionals that are known to be quite accurate at equilibrium geometries. Here, we show that the XYG3 and XYGJ-OS functionals can be ill behaved for stretched bonds well beyond the Coulson-Fischer point, predicting unphysical dipole moments and humps in potential energy curves for some simple systems like the hydrogen fluoride molecule. Numerical experiments and analysis show that these failures are not due to PT2. Instead, a large mismatch at stretched bond-lengths between the reference B3LYP orbitals and the optimized orbitals associated with the non-PT2 part of XYG3 leads to an unphysically large non-Hellman-Feynman contribution to first order properties like forces and electron densities.},

              We present the GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions. Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme
              J. Chem. Theory Comput.
              , 2011,
              7
              , 291], it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems—with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time—and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community
              via
              a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.},

  abstract = {A simple modification of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.},

  abstract = {Whither the density in DFT calculations?
            
              The continuing development of density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded the size and complexity of molecules amenable to computationally tractable simulation. The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev
              et al.
              examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density.

            Certain recent approaches to density functional theory have sacrificed fidelity to the true electron density.
          , 
            The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.},

  abstract  = {Non-covalent interactions (NCIs) play a crucial role in biology, chemistry, material science, and everything in between. To improve pure quantum-chemical simulations of NCIs, we propose a methodology for constructing approximate correlation energies by combining an interpolation along the M\{{\textbackslash}o\}ller adiabatic connection (MP AC) with a regularization and spin-scaling strategy applied to MP2 correlation energies. This combination yields \$c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}\$-SPL2, which exhibits superior accuracy for NCIs compared to any of the individual strategies. With the \$N{\textasciicircum}4\$ formal scaling, \$c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}\$-SPL2, is competitive or often outperforms more expensive dispersion-corrected double hybrids for NCIs.The accuracy of \$c\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm os\}\$-SPL2 particularly shines for anionic halogen bonded complexes, where it surpasses standard dispersion-corrected DFT by a factor of 3 to 5.},

We show that most of DHs provide a statistically robust performance to model barrier height and reaction energies in reaching the “chemical accuracy.” In particular, we show that nonempirical DHs, such as PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH, or minimally parameterized alternatives, such as ωB2PLYP and B2K-PLYP, succeed to accurately model both properties in a balanced fashion. We demonstrate, however, that parameterized approaches, such as ωB97X-2 or DSD-like DHs, are more biased to only one of both properties.},

A near chemical accuracy is established for this set, which, in turn, leads to a substantial improvement for the calculated equilibrium and onset potentials as against the experimental values for CO

              Static polarizabilities are the first response of the electron density to electric fields, and are therefore important for predicting intermolecular and molecule-field interactions. They also offer a global measure of the accuracy of the treatment of excited states by density functionals in a formally exact manner. We have developed a database of benchmark static polarizabilities for 132 small species at equilibrium geometry, using coupled cluster theory through triple excitations (extrapolated to the complete basis set limit), for the purpose of developing and assessing density functionals. The performance of 60 popular and recent functionals are also assessed, which indicates that double hybrid functionals perform the best, having RMS relative errors in the range of 2.5–3.8\%. Many hybrid functionals also give quite reasonable estimates with 4–5\% RMS relative error. A few

Results of calculations with 6s6p5d basis sets for MH, MH+, and MH2 are compared with all-electron and 2-valence-electron pseudopotential calculations with and without core-polarization potentials. The 10-valence-electron pseudopotential approach agrees well with all-electron calculations. It circumvents problems for the 2-valence-electron pseudopotentials arising from an incomplete separation of valence and subvalence shells in polar molecular systems due to strongly contracted occupied (n−1)-d orbitals. All higher-level calculations show SrH2 and BaH2 to be bent with angles of ∼140° and 120°, respectively, while CaH2 is linear with a flat potential-energy surface for the bending motion. The use of a core-polarization potential together with the 2-valence-electron pseudopotential approach allows an investigation of the relative importance of core-polarization vs direct d-orbital bonding participation as reasons for the bent structures. The calculations strongly suggest that both contribute to the bending in SrH2 and BaH2. Even at the Hartree–Fock level of theory 10-valence-electron pseudopotential calculations given reasonable angles when the potential-energy surface is not exceedingly flat, and only moderately contracted basis sets including both compact d functions and diffuse p functions are used. The effect of core-valence correlation and the importance of f functions also are discussed.},

The errors of the RI approximation using optimized auxiliary basis sets are analyzed on a comprehensive test set of molecules containing the most common oxidation states of each element and do not exceed those of the corresponding unaugmented basis sets. During these studies an unsatisfying performance of the def2-SVP and def2-QZVPP auxiliary basis sets for Barium was found and improved sets are provided. We establish the versatility of the def2-SVPD, def2-TZVPPD, and def2-QZVPPD basis sets for RI-MP2 and RI-CC (coupled-cluster) energy and property calculations. The influence of diffuse basis functions on correlation energy, basis set superposition error, atomic electron affinity, dipole moments, and computational timings is evaluated at different levels of theory using benchmark sets and showcase examples.},

          , 
            The goal of this work is to develop a gradient approximation to the exchange–correlation functional of Kohn–Sham density functional theory for treating molecular problems with a special emphasis on the prediction of quantities important for homogeneous catalysis and other molecular energetics. Our training and validation of exchange–correlation functionals is organized in terms of databases and subdatabases. The key properties required for homogeneous catalysis are main group bond energies (database MGBE137), transition metal bond energies (database TMBE32), reaction barrier heights (database BH76), and molecular structures (database MS10). We also consider 26 other databases, most of which are subdatabases of a newly extended broad database called Database 2015, which is presented in the present article and in its ESI. Based on the mathematical form of a nonseparable gradient approximation (NGA), as first employed in the N12 functional, we design a new functional by using Database 2015 and by adding smoothness constraints to the optimization of the functional. The resulting functional is called the gradient approximation for molecules, or GAM. The GAM functional gives better results for MGBE137, TMBE32, and BH76 than any available generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or than N12. The GAM functional also gives reasonable results for MS10 with an MUE of 0.018 Å. The GAM functional provides good results both within the training sets and outside the training sets. The convergence tests and the smooth curves of exchange–correlation enhancement factor as a function of the reduced density gradient show that the GAM functional is a smooth functional that should not lead to extra expense or instability in optimizations. NGAs, like GGAs, have the advantage over meta-GGAs and hybrid GGAs of respectively smaller grid-size requirements for integrations and lower costs for extended systems. These computational advantages combined with the relatively high accuracy for all the key properties needed for molecular catalysis make the GAM functional very promising for future applications.},

  abstract   = {The largest double-hybrid DFT study cleans up the ‘zoo’ of non-empirical double hybrids and reveals their lack of general applicability.
          , 
            
              The development of non-empirical double-hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) is a very active research area with the number of approaches in this field having increased rapidly. At the same time, there is a lack of published work that provides a fair assessment and comparison between non-empirical and semi-empirical DHDFs on an equal footing. Herein, we close this gap and present a thorough analysis of both classes of DHDFs on the large GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk
              et al.
              ,
              Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.
              , 2017,
              19
              , 32184–32215]. In total, 115 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected DHDFs are tested, which will be condensed to an in-depth assessment of 31 methods: 19 non-empirical and 12 semi-empirical DHDFs. As such, our study represents the largest DHDF study ever conducted and can serve as an important benchmark informing method developers and users alike. Our results show that semi-empirical DHDFs are the most robust density functional approximations and more reliable and accurate than non-empirical ones. In fact, some non-empirical approaches are even outperformed by hybrid approaches or even dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected MP2 and SCS-MP2. SOS0-PBE0-2-D3(BJ) is the only exception and the only non-empirical DHDF that we can safely recommend for general applicability. However, it is still outperformed by six semi-empirical DHDFs, of which we would like to particularly recommend the following five: ωB97X-2-D3(BJ), DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), B2NC-PLYP-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). Our findings seriously question current trends in the field and they highlight that novel strategies have to be found in order to outperform the currently best density functional theory methods on the market. We hope that our study can function as an important cornerstone inspiring such a change of direction in the field.},

              355:49–52] that the development of density functional approximations (DFAs) is “straying from the path toward the exact functional.” The exact functional should yield both exact energy and density for a system of interest; nevertheless, they found that many heavily fitted functionals for molecular energies actually lead to poor electron densities of atoms. They also observed a trend that, for the nonempirical and few-parameter functionals, densities can be improved as one climbs up the first four rungs of the Jacob’s ladder of DFAs. The XYG3 type of doubly hybrid functionals (xDHs) represents a less-empirical and fewer-parameter functional on the top fifth rung, in which both the Hartree–Fock-like exchange and the second-order perturbative (MP2-like) correlation are hybridized with the low rung functionals. Here, we show that xDHs can well describe both density and energy for the same atomic set of Medvedev et al., showing that the latter trend can well be extended to the top fifth rung.},

  abstract   = {As previously shown [M. Levy and J. P. Perdew, Phys. Rev. A (in press)], the customary Hohenberg–Kohn density functional, based on the universal functional F[ ρ], does not exhibit naively expected scaling properties. Namely, if ρλ=λ3ρ(λr) is the scaled density corresponding to ρ(r), the expected scaling, not satisfied, is T[ρλ]=λ2T[ρ] and V[ρλ]=λV[ρ], where T and V are the kinetic and potential energy components. By defining a new functional of ρ and λ, F[ ρ, λ], it is now shown how the naive scaling can be preserved. The definition is F[ρ(r), λ]=〈λ3N/2 Φminρλ (λr1... λrN){\textbar}T̂(r1...rN) +Vee(r1...rN){\textbar} λ3N/2Φminρλ(λr1...λrN)〉, where λ3N/2 Φminρλ(λr1... λrN) is that antisymmetric function Φ which yields ρλ(r)=λ3ρ(λr) and simultaneously minimizes 〈Φ{\textbar}T̂(r1...rN) +λVee(r1...rN){\textbar}Φ〉. The corresponding variational principle is EvG.S.=Infλ, ρ(r)\{∫  drv(r) ρλ(r)+λ2T[ ρ(r)] +λVee[ ρ(r)]\}, where EvG.S. is the ground-state energy for potential v(r). One is thus allowed to satisfy the virial theorem by optimum scaling just as if the naive scaling relations were correct for F[ ρ].},

  abstract = {The form of the Kohn–Sham (KS) exchange potential, which arises from the approximation that the Hartree–Fock (HF) and the exchange-only KS determinant are equal, is derived. Two related procedures to determine the KS exchange potential follow from this approximation: a self-consistent localized HF procedure and a transformation localized HF procedure yielding the local KS exchange potential from HF orbitals. Both procedures can be considered as almost exact exchange KS methods which require only occupied orbitals and are invariant with respect to unitary transformations of the orbitals, i.e., depend only on the first order density matrix. The resulting local KS exchange potentials are free of Coulomb self-interactions and exhibit the correct long-range 1/r-behavior. The Krieger, Li, and Iafrate (KLI) procedure to determine the KS exchange potential can be considered as an approximation to the introduced localized HF procedures. Highly efficient methods to carry out the presented localized HF as well as KLI procedures are introduced. An efficient basis set approach to calculate the Slater potential is presented. The methods can easily be implemented in present standard quantum chemistry codes. Applications to small and medium size molecules and clusters are presented. The Hartree–Fock and the exchange-only KS determinant are found to be surprisingly close. Qualitatively correct, Coulomb self-interaction free KS orbitals and eigenvalue spectra are obtained.},

  abstract = {We provide a rigorous derivation of a class of double-hybrid approximations, combining Hartree–Fock exchange and second-order Møller–Plesset correlation with a semilocal exchange-correlation density functional. These double-hybrid approximations contain only one empirical parameter and use a density-scaled correlation energy functional. Neglecting density scaling leads to a one-parameter version of the standard double-hybrid approximations. We assess the performance of these double-hybrid schemes on representative test sets of atomization energies and reaction barrier heights, and we compare to other hybrid approximations, including range-separated hybrids. Our best one-parameter double-hybrid approximation, called 1DH-BLYP, roughly reproduces the two parameters of the standard B2-PLYP or B2GP-PLYP double-hybrid approximations, which shows that these methods are not only empirically close to an optimum for general chemical applications but are also theoretically supported.},

  abstract = {We show that density functional theory within the RPA (random phase approximation for the exchange-correlation energy) provides a correct description of bond dissociation in H2 in a spin-restricted Kohn–Sham formalism, i.e., without artificial symmetry breaking. We present accurate adiabatic connection curves both at equilibrium and beyond the Coulson–Fisher point. The strong curvature at large bond length implies important static (left–right) correlation, justifying modern hybrid functional constructions but also demonstrating their limitations. Although exact at infinite separation and accurate near the equilibrium bond length, the RPA dissociation curve displays unphysical repulsion at larger but finite bond lengths. Going beyond the RPA by including the exact exchange kernel (RPA+X), we find a similar repulsion. We argue that this deficiency is due to the absence of double excitations in adiabatic linear response theory. Further analyzing the H2 dissociation limit we show that the RPA+X is not size consistent, in contrast to the RPA.},

  abstract = {In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)10.1063/1.3173827]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 105–106 relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., \&gt;100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below \&lt;0.05\%, which implies typically 15–20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD (“domain based LPNO-CCSD”). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured \&gt;8800 basis functions and \&gt;450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.},

  abstract   = {In this communication, an improved perturbative triples correction (T) algorithm for domain based local pair-natural orbital singles and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) theory is reported. In our previous implementation, the semi-canonical approximation was used and linear scaling was achieved for both the DLPNO-CCSD and (T) parts of the calculation. In this work, we refer to this previous method as DLPNO-CCSD(T0) to emphasize the semi-canonical approximation. It is well-established that the DLPNO-CCSD method can predict very accurate absolute and relative energies with respect to the parent canonical CCSD method. However, the (T0) approximation may introduce significant errors in absolute energies as the triples correction grows up in magnitude. In the majority of cases, the relative energies from (T0) are as accurate as the canonical (T) results of themselves. Unfortunately, in rare cases and in particular for small gap systems, the (T0) approximation breaks down and relative energies show large deviations from the parent canonical CCSD(T) results. To address this problem, an iterative (T) algorithm based on the previous DLPNO-CCSD(T0) algorithm has been implemented [abbreviated here as DLPNO-CCSD(T)]. Using triples natural orbitals to represent the virtual spaces for triples amplitudes, storage bottlenecks are avoided. Various carefully designed approximations ease the computational burden such that overall, the increase in the DLPNO-(T) calculation time over DLPNO-(T0) only amounts to a factor of about two (depending on the basis set). Benchmark calculations for the GMTKN30 database show that compared to DLPNO-CCSD(T0), the errors in absolute energies are greatly reduced and relative energies are moderately improved. The particularly problematic case of cumulene chains of increasing lengths is also successfully addressed by DLPNO-CCSD(T).},

            Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopy technique with sensitivity down to the single molecule level that provides fine molecular fingerprints, allowing for direct identification of target analytes. Extensive theoretical and experimental research, together with continuous development of nanotechnology, has significantly broadened the scope of SERS and made it a hot research field in chemistry, physics, materials, biomedicine, and so on. However, SERS has not been developed into a routine analytical technique, and continuous efforts have been made to address the problems preventing its real-world application. The present minireview focuses on analyzing current and potential strategies to tackle problems and realize the SERS performance necessary for translation to practical applications.},

Great emphasis is placed on the use of the Hartree–Fock function as an approximate wavefunction, and a number of its properties are discussed and re-emphasised. The main content of this paper is the development of a perturbed Hartree–Fock theory that makes possible the direct calculation of force constants and dipole-moment derivatives from SCF–MO wavefunctions. Essentially the theory yields ∂φi / ∂RJα, the derivative of an MO with respect to a nuclear coordinate.},

The calculated values for the force constant ke and the dipole‐moment derivative μ(1) are (experimental values in parentheses): LiH, ke = 1.618(1.026) mdyn/Å, μ(1) = −18.77(−2.0±0.3) D/Å BH, ke = 5.199(3.032) mdyn/Å, μ(1) = −1.03(−)D/Å; HF, ke = 12.90(9.651) mdyn/Å, μ(1) = −2.15(+1.50) D/Å. The values of the force on the proton were calculated exactly and according to the Hellmann–Feynman theorem in each case, and the discrepancies show that none of the wavefunctions used are close to the Hartree–Fock limit, so that the large errors in ke and μ(1) are not surprising. However no difficulties arose in the perturbed Hartree–Fock calculation, so that the application of the theory to more accurate wavefunctions appears quite feasible.},

The method is applied to H2O using an extended basis set for the MBPT (2), MBPT (3), and SDQ-MBPT (4) levels of theory.

          , 
            
              Algorithms and working expressions for a grid-based fast multipole method (GB-FMM) have been developed and implemented. The computational domain is divided into cubic subdomains, organized in a hierarchical tree. The contribution to the electrostatic interaction energies from pairs of neighboring subdomains is computed using numerical integration, whereas the contributions from further apart subdomains are obtained using multipole expansions. The multipole moments of the subdomains are obtained by numerical integration. Linear scaling is achieved by translating and summing the multipoles according to the tree structure, such that each subdomain interacts with a number of subdomains that are almost independent of the size of the system. To compute electrostatic interaction energies of neighboring subdomains, we employ an algorithm which performs efficiently on general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPU). Calculations using one CPU for the FMM part and 20 GPGPUs consisting of tens of thousands of execution threads for the numerical integration algorithm show the scalability and parallel performance of the scheme. For calculations on systems consisting of Gaussian functions (

To this end, we develop a way of training self-consistent models that are capable of taking large datasets from different systems and different kinds of labels. We demonstrate that the functional that results from this training procedure gives chemically accurate predictions on energy, force, dipole, and electron density for a large class of molecules. It can be continuously improved when more and more data are available.},

Different types of DH functionals have been proposed according to different philosophies. DH functionals are shown to better fulfill certain physical conditions such as the linearity condition for fractional charges than other conventional functionals, which accounts for the generally improved performances of DH functionals in the description of thermochemistry and thermochemical kinetics for the main group chemistry. Efforts shall be made toward the construction of parameter-free DH functionals and the proper description of the dissociation limit with strong static correlation.

  abstract = {The conventional analysis of Perdew and Levy, and Sham and Schlüter shows that the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation density functional plays a critical role in the correct prediction of bandgaps, or the chemical hardness. In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for bandgap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contributes to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the number of electrons, {\textbackslash}documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\$(({\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}rho \_\{s\}({\textbackslash}mathbf \{r{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\},{\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\}))/{\textbackslash}partial N )\_\{v\_\{s\}\}\${\textbackslash}end\{document\}((∂ρs(r′,r))/∂N)vs, at integers. (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schlüter conclusion that the exact Kohn-Sham energy gap differs from the fundamental bandgap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be an explicit and differentiable functional of the electron density, either local or nonlocal. The last result is further strengthened when we consider Mott insulators. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous (nondifferentiable) dependence on the density or the density matrix. (4) We obtain exact conditions on the derivatives of total energy with respect to the spin-up and spin-down number of electrons.},
