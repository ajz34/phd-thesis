This makes it a general-purpose functional whose domain of applicability has been extended to transition states, rather than a specialized functional for kinetics. The improvement in BMK rests on the inclusion of the kinetic energy density together with a large value of the exact exchange mixing coefficient. For this functional, the kinetic energy density appears to correct ``back'' the excess exact exchange mixing for ground-state properties, possibly simulating variable exchange.},

It is based on a quadratic form that models the integrand of the coupling parameter, whose components are chosen to satisfy several well-known limiting conditions. Its integration leads to DHs containing a single parameter controlling the amount of exact exchange, which is determined by requiring it to depend on the weight of the MP2 correlation contribution. Two new parameter-free DHs functionals are derived in this way, by incorporating the non-empirical PBE and TPSS functionals in the underlying expression. Their extensive testing using the GMTKN30 benchmark indicates that they are in competition with state-of-the-art DHs, yet providing much better self-interaction errors and opening a new avenue towards the design of accurate double-hybrid exchange-correlation functionals departing from the AC integrand.},

The success of the resulting models is illustrated by an accurate modeling of several molecular systems and properties, like ionization potentials, particularly prone to the one- and many-electron self-interaction errors.},

Overall its performances are comparable to the ones found using other parameterized double hybrids.

  abstract = {The regularized and restored semilocal meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) exchange{\textendash}correlation functional r2SCAN [Furness et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208{\textendash}8215 (2020)] is used to create three global hybrid functionals with varying admixtures of Hartree{\textendash}Fock ``exact'' exchange (HFX). The resulting functionals r2SCANh (10\% HFX), r2SCAN0 (25\% HFX), and r2SCAN50 (50\% HFX) are combined with the semi-classical D4 London dispersion correction. The new functionals are assessed for the calculation of molecular geometries, main-group, and metalorganic thermochemistry at 26 comprehensive benchmark sets. These include the extensive GMTKN55 database, ROST61, and IONPI19 sets. It is shown that a moderate admixture of HFX leads to relative improvements of the mean absolute deviations for thermochemistry of 11\% (r2SCANh-D4), 16\% (r2SCAN0-D4), and 1\% (r2SCAN50-D4) compared to the parental semi-local meta-GGA. For organometallic reaction energies and barriers, r2SCAN0-D4 yields an even larger mean improvement of 35\%. The computation of structural parameters (geometry optimization) does not systematically profit from the HFX admixture. Overall, the best variant r2SCAN0-D4 performs well for both main-group and organometallic thermochemistry and is better or on par with well-established global hybrid functionals, such as PW6B95-D4 or PBE0-D4. Regarding systems prone to self-interaction errors (SIE4x4), r2SCAN0-D4 shows reasonable performance, reaching the quality of the range-separated {$\omega$}B97X-V functional. Accordingly, r2SCAN0-D4 in combination with a sufficiently converged basis set [def2-QZVP(P)] represents a robust and reliable choice for general use in the calculation of thermochemical properties of both main-group and organometallic chemistry.},

One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2{$\pi$}               h               )               3               , and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

For the atomization energies of the G2 set, we find that the PBE functional shows systematic errors larger than those of commonly used empirical functionals. The PBE ionization potentials, electron affinities, and bond lengths are of accuracy similar to those obtained from empirical functionals. Furthermore, a recently proposed hybrid scheme using exact exchange together with PBE exchange and correlation is investigated. For all properties studied here, the PBE hybrid gives an accuracy comparable to the frequently used empirical B3LYP hybrid scheme. Physical principles underlying the PBE and PBE hybrid scheme are examined and the range of their validity is discussed.},

The hole model is applied to atoms and molecules, and a comparison is made to exact and LSD angle- and system-averaged exchange holes.

Furthermore, the GGA hole model accurately describes the change in the exchange hole upon the formation of single bonds, but is less accurate for the formation of multiple bonds, where it misses the appearance of a long-range tail.},

Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)] is constructed as a chemical environment-determined interpolation between two separate energy densities: one describes single-orbital electron densities accurately and another describes slowly varying densities accurately. To conserve constraints known for the exact exchange{\textendash}correlation functional, the derivatives of this interpolation vanish in the slowly varying limit. While theoretically convenient, this choice introduces numerical challenges that degrade the functional's efficiency. We have recently reported a modification to the SCAN meta-GGA, termed restored-regularized-SCAN (r2SCAN) [Furness et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], that introduces two regularizations into SCAN, which improve its numerical performance at the expense of not recovering the fourth order term of the slowly varying density gradient expansion for exchange. Here, we show the derivation of a progression of density functional approximations [regularized SCAN (rSCAN), r++SCAN, r2SCAN, and r4SCAN] with increasing adherence to exact conditions while maintaining a smooth interpolation. The greater smoothness of r2SCAN seems to lead to better general accuracy than the additional exact constraint of SCAN or r4SCAN does.},

  abstract = {A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (ax) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum ax is found to be quite large (53\% with c=27\%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10{\textendash}20kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.},

In this paper we use the same method to develop a new GGA functional, denoted HCTH, based on an expansion recently suggested by Becke [J. Chem. Phys. 107, 8554 (1997)]. For our extensive training set, the new functional yields improved energetics compared to both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals [Phys. Rev. A 38, 3098 (1988); Phys. Rev. B 37, 785 (1988); J. Chem. Phys. 98, 5648 (1993); J. Phys. Chem. 98, 11623 (1994)]. The geometries of these systems, together with those of a set of transition metal compounds, are shown to be an improvement over the BLYP functional, while the reaction barriers for six hydrogen abstraction reactions are comparable to those of B3LYP. These improvements are achieved without introducing any fraction of exact orbital exchange into the new functional. We have also re-optimized the functional of Becke{\textemdash}which does involve exact exchange{\textemdash}for use in self-consistent calculations.},

  abstract = {Long-range-corrected hybrids, which incorporate all of the long-range exact exchange interaction, improve performance for a host of molecular properties. The long-range portion of exact exchange is both computationally and formally problematic in solids, and screened hybrids therefore eliminate it. While screened hybrids give similar results to their parent global hybrids for many molecular properties, one may worry that they perform poorly for those properties that are improved by the long-range-correction procedure. In this paper, we show that at least for the Heyd{\textendash}Scuseria{\textendash}Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid, this is not the case; for many properties improved by long-range-correction, screened hybrids and global hybrids deliver essentially the same results. We suggest that this is because screened hybrids and global hybrids have fundamentally the same many-electron self-interaction error. We also introduce some small revisions to our computational implementation of the HSE screened hybrid, and we recommend these revisions for future applications of HSE.},

The performance of this functional is assessed on a variety of molecules for the prediction of enthalpies of formation, geometries, and vibrational frequencies, yielding results as good as or better than the successful PBE0 hybrid functional. Results for ionization potentials and electron affinities are of slightly lower quality but are still acceptable. The comprehensive test results presented here validate our assumption that the screened, short-range Hartree{\textendash}Fock (HF) exchange exhibits all physically relevant properties of the full HF exchange. Thus, hybrids can be constructed which neglect the computationally demanding long-range part of HF exchange while still retaining the superior accuracy of hybrid functionals, compared to pure density functionals.},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree{\textendash}Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree{\textendash}Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.},

The calculated results of the long-range correction scheme are found to support a previous argument that the lack of the long-range interactions in conventional exchange functionals may be responsible for the underestimation of 4s-3d interconfigurational energies of the first-row transition metals and for the overestimation of the longitudinal polarizabilities of {$\pi$}-conjugated polyenes in DFT calculations.},

Despite emerging applications of machine learning (ML) in approximating functionals, the resulting ML functionals usually contain more than tens of thousands of parameters, leading to a huge gap in the formulation with the conventional human-designed symbolic functionals. We propose a new framework, Symbolic Functional Evolutionary Search (SyFES), that automatically constructs accurate functionals in the symbolic form, which is more explainable to humans, cheaper to evaluate, and easier to integrate to existing codes than other ML functionals. We first show that, without prior knowledge, SyFES reconstructed a known functional from scratch. We then demonstrate that evolving from an existing functional ?B97M-V, SyFES found a new functional, GAS22 (Google Accelerated Science 22), that performs better for most of the molecular types in the test set of Main Group Chemistry Database (MGCDB84). Our framework opens a new direction in leveraging computing power for the systematic development of symbolic density functionals. Machine learning composes density functionals in symbolic forms with similar simplicity as human-designed ones.},

Lett. 91, 146401 (2003)] for the exchange-correlation energy, imposing exact constraints relevant to the paradigm densities of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. Results of their extensive tests on molecules, solids, and solid surfaces are encouraging, suggesting that this density functional achieves uniform accuracy for diverse properties and systems. In the present work, this functional is explained and details of its construction are presented. In particular, the functional is constructed to yield accurate energies under uniform coordinate scaling to the low-density or strong-interaction limit. Its nonlocality is displayed by plotting the factor Fxc that gives the enhancement relative to the local density approximation for exchange. We also discuss an apparently harmless order-of-limits problem in the meta-GGA. The performance of this functional is investigated for exchange and correlation energies and shell-removal energies of atoms and ions. Non-self-consistent molecular atomization energies and bond lengths of the TPSS meta-GGA, calculated with GGA orbitals and densities, agree well with those calculated self-consistently. We suggest that satisfaction of additional exact constraints on higher rungs of a ladder of density functional approximations can lead to further progress.},

  abstract = {An extension of density functional theory to situations with significant nondynamical correlation is presented. The method is based on the spin{\textendash}flip (SF) approach which is capable of describing multireference wave functions within a single reference formalism as spin{\textendash}flipping, e.g., {$\alpha\rightarrow\beta$}, excitations from a high-spin (Ms=1) triplet reference state. An implementation of the spin{\textendash}flip approach within the Tamm{\textendash}Dancoff approximation to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is presented. The new method, SF-TDDFT/TDA or simply SF-DFT, describes target states (i.e., closed- and open-shell singlets, as well as low-spin triplets) by linear response from a reference high-spin triplet (Ms=1) Kohn{\textendash}Sham state. Contrary to traditional TDDFT, the SF-DFT response equations are solved in a subspace of spin{\textendash}flipping operators. The method is applied to bond-breaking (ethylene torsional potential), and equilibrium properties of eight diradicals. The results demonstrate significant improvement over traditional Kohn{\textendash}Sham DFT, particularly for 50/50 hybrid functional.},

Principal results are presented in the form of statistical summaries of deviations from experiment for the G3/99 test set (223 enthalpies of formation, 86 ionization potentials, 58 electron affinities, 8 proton affinities) and three additional test sets involving 96 bond lengths, 82 harmonic vibrational frequencies, and 10 hydrogen-bonded complexes, all computed using the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis. The TPSS functional matches, or exceeds in accuracy all prior nonempirical constructions and, unlike semiempirical functionals, consistently provides a high-quality description of diverse systems and properties. The computational cost of self-consistent MGGA is comparable to that of ordinary GGA, and exact exchange (unavailable in some codes) is not required. A one-parameter global hybrid version of the TPSS functional is introduced and shown to give further improvement for most properties.},

We present a screened-exchange hybrid functional, M06-SX, that combines the functional form of the local revM06-L functional with a percentage of short-range nonlocal Hartree{\textendash}Fock exchange. The M06-SX functional gives good results not only for a large set of training data but also for several databases quite different from the training data. The mean unsigned error (MUE) of the M06-SX functional is 2.85 kcal/mol for 418 atomic and molecular energies (AME418) in Minnesota Database 2019, which is better than all five other screened-exchange hybrid functionals tested in this work. The M06-SX functional also gives especially good results for semiconductor band gaps, molecular dissociation energies, noncovalent interactions, barrier heights, and electronic excitation energies excluding long-range charge transfer excitations. For the LC18 lattice constants database, the M06-SX functional gives an MUE of only 0.034 {\AA}.

The M06 and M06-2X functionals, which are hybrid metafunctionals, have been widely used due to their broad applicability. In this study, we present a hybrid metafunctional called revM06 that has broader accuracy than either M06 or M06-2X. As a result, the revM06 functional is well suited for a broad range of applications on main-group chemistry, transition-metal chemistry, and molecular structure prediction. The reoptimization takes advantage of the better databases and of our recently developed strategy for obtaining smoother functionals.           ,              We present a hybrid metageneralized-gradient-approximation functional, revM06, which is based on adding Hartree{\textendash}Fock exchange to the revM06-L functional form.

The revM06 functional improves on the M06-2X functional for main-group and transition-metal bond energies, atomic excitation energies, isomerization energies of large molecules, molecular structures, and both weakly and strongly correlated atomic and molecular data, and it shows a clear improvement over M06 and M06-2X for noncovalent interactions, including smoother potential curves for rare-gas dimers. The revM06 functional also predicts more accurate results than M06 and M06-2X for most of the outside-the-training-set test sets examined in this study. Therefore, the revM06 functional is well-suited for a broad range of chemical applications for both main-group and transition-metal elements.},

  abstract = {Significance             Local exchange-correlation functionals, which depend on the local spin densities, their gradients, and the local spin-specific kinetic energy densities, have been widely used for electronic structure calculations in both chemistry and physics, owing to their computational efficiency in plane wave codes and for large molecules and to their relatively high accuracy for transition metals and other inherently multiconfigurational systems. Minnesota 2006 local functional (M06-L) has proven to be one of the most accurate local functionals currently available, but it has room for improvement with regard to numerical stability and overall accuracy. Here we present a revised M06-L functional, named revM06-L, which gives both smoother potential energy curves and improved overall accuracy, especially for chemical reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, and solid-state physics.           ,              We present the revM06-L functional, which we designed by optimizing against a larger database than had been used for Minnesota 2006 local functional (M06-L) and by using smoothness restraints. The optimization strategy reduced the number of parameters from 34 to 31 because we removed some large terms that increased the required size of the quadrature grid and the number of self-consistent-field iterations. The mean unsigned error (MUE) of revM06-L on 422 chemical energies is 3.07 kcal/mol, which is improved from 3.57 kcal/mol calculated by M06-L. The MUE of revM06-L for the chemical reaction barrier height database (BH76) is 1.98 kcal/mol, which is improved by more than a factor of 2 with respect to the M06-L functional. The revM06-L functional gives the best result among local functionals tested for the noncovalent interaction database (NC51), with an MUE of only 0.36 kcal/mol, and the MUE of revM06-L for the solid-state lattice constant database (LC17) is half that for M06-L. The revM06-L functional also yields smoother potential curves, and it predicts more-accurate results than M06-L for seven out of eight diversified test sets not used for parameterization. We conclude that the revM06-L functional is well suited for a broad range of applications in chemistry and condensed-matter physics.},

  abstract = {Multiplicative potentials, appropriate for adding to the non-multiplicative fractional orbital exchange term in the Kohn{\textendash}Sham equations, are determined from correlated ab initio electron densities. The potentials are examined graphically and are used in conjunction with conventional thermochemical data to determine a new hybrid exchange-correlation functional, denoted B97-2. Calculations using B97-2 are compared with those from (a) the B97-1 functional [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 6264 (1998)], which has the same functional form and fraction of orbital exchange, but was fitted to just thermochemical data; and (b) the widely used B3LYP functional [J. Chem. Phys. 98, 5648 (1993)]. B97-2 atomization energies are close to those from B97-1; total electronic energies and ionization potentials are less accurate, but remain an improvement over B3LYP. Molecular structures from all three functionals are comparable. Static isotropic polarizabilities improve from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2; the B97-2 functional underestimates experimental values, which is consistent with the neglect of zero-point vibrational corrections. NMR shielding constants{\textemdash}determined as the conventional second derivative of the electronic energy{\textemdash}improve from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2. Shieldings determined directly from these DFT electron densities using the recently proposed MKS approach [Chem. Phys. Lett. 337, 341 (2001)] are two to three times more accurate than the conventional shieldings, and exhibit an analogous improvement across the three functionals. Classical reaction barriers for sixteen chemical reactions improve significantly from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2. The introduction of multiplicative potentials into semi-empirical hybrid functional development therefore appears beneficial.},

Here we report a new functional, called MN15, that has broader accuracy than any previously available one. The properties considered in the parameterization include bond energies, atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, isomerization energies, electronic excitation energies, absolute atomic energies, and molecular structures. When compared with 82 other density functionals that have been defined in the literature, MN15 gives the second smallest mean unsigned error (MUE) for 54 data on inherently multiconfigurational systems, the smallest MUE for 313 single-reference chemical data, and the smallest MUE on 87 noncovalent data, with MUEs for these three categories of 4.75, 1.85, and 0.25 kcal mol               -1               , respectively, as compared to the average MUEs of the other 82 functionals of 14.0, 4.63, and 1.98 kcal mol               -1               .

We further tested MN15 for 10 transition-metal coordination energies, the entire S66x8 database of noncovalent interactions, 21 transition-metal reaction barrier heights, 69 electronic excitation energies of organic molecules, 31 semiconductor band gaps, seven transition-metal dimer bond lengths, and 193 bond lengths of 47 organic molecules. The MN15 functional not only performs very well for our training set, which has 481 pieces of data, but also performs very well for our test set, which has 823 data that are not in our training set. The test set includes both ground-state properties and molecular excitation energies. For the latter MN15 achieves simultaneous accuracy for both valence and Rydberg electronic excitations when used with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory, with an MUE of less than 0.3 eV for both types of excitations.},

  abstract = {Recently, a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the density functional, called PBEsol, was optimized (one parameter) against the jellium-surface exchange-correlation energies, and this, in conjunction with changing another parameter to restore the first-principles gradient expansion for exchange, was sufficient to yield accurate lattice constants of solids. Here, we construct a new GGA that has no empirical parameters, that satisfies one more exact constraint than PBEsol, and that performs 20\% better for the lattice constants of 18 previously studied solids, although it does not improve on PBEsol for molecular atomization energies (a property that neither functional was designed for). The new GGA is exact through second order, and it is called the second-order generalized gradient approximation (SOGGA). The SOGGA functional also differs from other GGAs in that it enforces a tighter Lieb{\textendash}Oxford bound. SOGGA and other functionals are compared to a diverse set of lattice constants, bond distances, and energetic quantities for solids and molecules (this includes the first test of the M06-L meta-GGA for solid-state properties). We find that classifying density functionals in terms of the magnitude {$\mu$} of the second-order coefficient of the density gradient expansion of the exchange functional not only correlates their behavior for predicting lattice constants of solids versus their behavior for predicting small-molecule atomization energies, as pointed out by Perdew and co-workers [Phys. Rev. Lett.\hphantom{,}100, 134606 (2008); PerdewPhys. Rev.

  abstract = {By incorporating kinetic-energy density in a balanced way in the exchange and correlational functionals and removing self-correlation effects, we have designed a density functional that is broadly applicable to organometallic, inorganometallic, and nonmetallic bonding, thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and noncovalent interactions as well as satisfying the uniform electron gas limit. The average error is reduced by a factor of 1.3 compared with the best previously available functionals, but even more significantly, we find a functional that has a high accuracy for all four categories of interaction.},
